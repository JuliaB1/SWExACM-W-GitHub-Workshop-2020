# SWExACM-W GitHub Workshop 2020

This is a GitHub repository! This is one of the most popular tools for collaborative web development (at least for right now). The most important components of a repository are arguably the main "code overview" page where you can click into the various files and examine their conents, and the commit history where you can view all the changes collaborators have made to the code.

Feel free to click around! This repository only has two files in it:
1) `quarantineRoutine.c`, a sample program for you to experiment with
2)  `README.md`, what you're reading right now! This typically is used by engineers to explain important aspects of the repository/instructions on how to run the program/anything else they deem necessary for new developers to know when looking at the repository for the first time. Always check out the README, and it's good practice to always include one in your repositories!
